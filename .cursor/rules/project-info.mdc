Project: Kivy Garden MarkdownLabel — a Kivy widget that parses Markdown with Mistune and renders it as interactive Kivy UI; meant as a drop-in Label replacement supporting links, headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and styling controls.

Key modules:
- `kivy_garden/markdownlabel/__init__.py`: exposes `MarkdownLabel` plus render/serialize helpers; builds AST with Mistune (tables + strikethrough plugins) and renders via `KivyRenderer`; serializes back to Markdown with `MarkdownSerializer`.
- `kivy_garden/markdownlabel/inline_renderer.py`: converts inline tokens to Kivy markup (bold/italic/code/links/etc) with markup escaping.
- `kivy_garden/markdownlabel/kivy_renderer.py`: block-level renderer building Kivy widget trees (headings with scaled sizes, lists with markers/indentation, code blocks with monospace + background, images via `AsyncImage`, nesting guards).
- `kivy_garden/markdownlabel/markdown_serializer.py`: AST→Markdown round-trip support for tests.
- Version in `kivy_garden/markdownlabel/_version.py`.

Packaging/deps: Python 3.8–3.12; installable as `kivy_garden.markdownlabel` (see `setup.py`). Runtime deps: `kivy>=2.0.0`, `mistune>=3.0.0`; extras for dev/test use pytest, hypothesis, coverage, sphinx. Flake8 config lives in `setup.cfg`.

Docs: Sphinx sources under `doc/`; published at https://kivy-garden.github.io/markdownlabel/.

Testing: pytest property-based tests in `kivy_garden/markdownlabel/tests/`; they set `KIVY_NO_ARGS=1` and `KIVY_NO_CONSOLELOG=1` for headless runs—keep those when running CI locally (e.g., `pytest` from repo root).

Repo structure note: `external/` contains vendored upstream Kivy and Mistune sources/docs/examples; usually leave untouched unless updating vendored copies.
