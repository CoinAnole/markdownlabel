- Line 877: Test method name `test_disabled_color_updates_value` suggests a value update test, but the implementation verifies rebuild behavior (calls `force_rebuild()`). According to testing guidelines, value update tests should not verify rebuilds and rebuild tests should use naming convention `test_*_triggers_rebuild_*` or `test_*_rebuilds_*`. The test should be renamed to `test_disabled_change_triggers_rebuild` to match its actual behavior.

- Line 59: Comment says "Combination strategy: 10 examples (combination coverage)" but `color_strategy` is a complex/infinite strategy, not a finite combination strategy. According to testing guidelines (lines 363-377), combination strategies are for finite strategies where the product size can be calculated. This should be classified as "Complex strategy" instead.
- Line 75: Comment says "Combination strategy: 10 examples (combination coverage)" but `text_padding_strategy` is a complex/infinite strategy, not a finite combination strategy. According to testing guidelines (lines 363-377), combination strategies are for finite strategies where the product size can be calculated. This should be classified as "Complex strategy" instead.
- Line 91: Comment says "Combination strategy: 10 examples (combination coverage)" but `st.floats(min_value=-1000, max_value=1000, allow_nan=False, allow_infinity=False)` is a complex/infinite strategy (large range with 2000+ possible values). According to testing guidelines (lines 363-377), combination strategies are for finite strategies where the product size can be calculated. This should be classified as "Complex strategy" instead.
- Line 146: Comment says "Complex strategy: 1 example (adequate coverage)" - Using `max_examples=1` for a complex strategy is unusual. According to testing guidelines (lines 379-391), complex strategies should use 10-50 examples based on complexity. While testing strategy availability might justify fewer examples, the rationale "adequate coverage" is too vague and should be more specific about why 1 example is sufficient for this particular test.
- Line 159: Comment says "Complex strategy: 1 example (adequate coverage)" - Same issue as line 146. Using `max_examples=1` for a complex strategy with vague rationale violates the guideline that complex strategies should use 10-50 examples.
- Line 172: Comment says "Complex strategy: 1 example (adequate coverage)" - Same issue as line 146. Using `max_examples=1` for a complex strategy with vague rationale violates the guideline that complex strategies should use 10-50 examples.
