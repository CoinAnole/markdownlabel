## test_import.py

- Line 9: Class name `TestMarkdownLabelImport` does not follow "one class per property/behavior" guideline. The class contains tests for both import functionality AND text property behavior. These should be separated into two distinct classes (e.g., `TestMarkdownLabelImport` for import tests and `TestTextProperty` for text property tests).
- Line 12-16: Test method `test_markdownlabel_import` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts. The method asserts that the label has a 'text' attribute using `hasattr`, but the name suggests it only tests import functionality. A more accurate name would be `test_markdownlabel_has_text_property` or `test_imported_markdownlabel_has_text_attribute`.
- Line 18-22: Test method `test_markdownlabel_text_property` name could be more precise. The method asserts text assignment (`label.text == '# Hello'`), not just the existence of the property. A more descriptive name would be `test_text_property_assignment` or `test_text_property_accepts_value`.
- Line 12-22: No use of property-based testing with Hypothesis strategies from test_utils.py. The guidelines encourage using property-based testing with strategies like `st_alphanumeric_text` for more comprehensive testing.
- Line 12-22: No max_examples comments present (not applicable as there is no property-based testing, but worth noting as a deviation from the encouraged testing approach).

## test_inline_renderer.py

- Line 15-73: Custom strategies (`text_token`, `strong_token`, `emphasis_token`, `codespan_token`, `strikethrough_token`, `link_token`) are defined in the test file instead of in `test_utils.py`. The guidelines state: "When adding new helper functions: 1. **Add to `test_utils.py`** - Never duplicate in individual test files" and "Always use helper functions from `test_utils.py` instead of duplicating code."
- Line 84, 96, 108, 118, 129, 147, 173, 207, 229, 413, 678, 764: All property-based tests use identical max_examples=20 with the same comment "Complex strategy: 20 examples (adequate coverage)". The guidelines provide specific classifications with different max_examples values for different strategy types (Boolean: 2, Small finite: input space size, Medium finite: 20-50 based on input space, Combination: product capped at 50, Complex: 10-50 based on complexity). These tests should be classified according to their actual strategy type rather than all using the same generic classification.
- Line 205-207: Strategy `st.text(alphabet='[]&', min_size=1, max_size=50)` is incorrectly classified as "Medium finite strategy: 50 examples (adequate finite coverage)". This is a complex/infinite strategy (3^50 possible combinations), not a finite strategy. The classification should be "Complex strategy" with an appropriate rationale.
- Line 401-411: The `st.one_of` strategy combining multiple text generation patterns is classified as "Complex strategy: 20 examples (adequate coverage)" but this is actually a combination strategy that should use the "Combination strategy" classification with rationale about sampling from multiple URL patterns.
- Line 657-676: The `st.one_of` strategy combining multiple HTML generation patterns is classified as "Complex strategy: 20 examples (adequate coverage)" but this is actually a combination strategy that should use the "Combination strategy" classification with rationale about sampling from multiple HTML patterns.
- Line 760-762: The strategy `st.text(min_size=0, max_size=200, alphabet=st.characters(whitelist_categories=['L', 'N', 'P', 'S', 'Z']))` is classified as "Complex strategy: 20 examples (adequate coverage)" but with a large max_size of 200, this could be considered a more complex strategy that might benefit from a different max_examples value or classification.

## test_kivy_renderer.py

- Line 38-40: Strategy `st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=5)` is classified as "Small finite strategy: 5 examples (input space size: 5)" but the heading level range is actually 1-6 (6 values), not 1-5. The test should use `min_value=1, max_value=6` with max_examples=6, or the classification should be updated to reflect the actual input space size of 5.
- Line 83-85: Strategy combining `st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=6)` (6 values) and `st.floats(min_value=10, max_value=30)` (infinite range) is classified as "Combination strategy: 10 examples (performance optimized)". This is a mixed finite/infinite strategy. The classification should be "Complex strategy" with rationale about testing heading levels with various base font sizes, as it combines a finite set with an infinite continuous range.
- Line 776-1083: Class `TestKivyRendererEdgeCases` contains tests for various edge cases and internal methods. While the class name is descriptive, it mixes multiple different behaviors (image callbacks, code block background updates, block quote border updates, table internals, deep nesting, unknown tokens, list items, text size binding, blank lines) in a single class. According to the guideline "One class per property or behavior", these should potentially be split into separate classes like `TestImageTextureCallback`, `TestCodeBlockBackgroundUpdate`, `TestBlockQuoteBorderUpdate`, `TestTableInternalMethods`, `TestDeepNestingTruncation`, `TestUnknownTokenHandling`, `TestListItemRendering`, `TestTextSizeBinding`, `TestBlankLineRendering`.
- Line 997-1011: Test method `test_deep_nesting_truncation` in `TestKivyRendererEdgeCases` duplicates functionality already tested in `TestDeepNestingTruncation` class (lines 682-769). The earlier class has comprehensive tests for truncation behavior including `test_truncation_placeholder_when_nesting_exceeds_max`, `test_truncation_placeholder_text_format`, `test_truncation_placeholder_styling`, and `test_normal_nesting_does_not_truncate`. This duplicate test should be removed to avoid redundancy.

## test_core_functionality.py

- Line 111-126: Test method `test_text_change_updates_widgets` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts. The method asserts that the label's text property reflects the new value (not that widgets were updated/rebuilt), but the name suggests it tests widget updates. A more accurate name would be `test_text_change_updates_text_property` or `test_text_property_updates_on_change`.
- Line 178-195: Test method `test_ast_updates_with_text` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts. The method only asserts that `label.text == text2` (the text property was updated), not that the AST was updated. The AST is collected but never compared or asserted against. A more accurate name would be `test_text_property_updates_on_change` or the test should be updated to actually verify AST updates.
- Line 111-195: Tests in `TestMarkdownTextPropertyUpdates` class do not use rebuild contract testing helpers from test_utils.py. The guidelines provide helper functions like `collect_widget_ids()`, `assert_rebuild_occurred()`, and `assert_no_rebuild()` for testing rebuild behavior. These tests manually check child counts or text properties instead of using the standardized rebuild testing helpers.
- Line 217-226: Test method `test_link_produces_ref_markup` manually iterates through children to find Labels with ref markup, duplicating traversal logic. The guidelines provide `find_labels_recursive()` helper from test_utils.py for finding all Label widgets in the tree. This test should use the shared helper instead of manual iteration.
- Line 239-246: Test method `test_link_url_in_ref_tag` manually iterates through children to find Labels with ref markup, duplicating traversal logic. The guidelines provide `find_labels_recursive()` helper from test_utils.py for finding all Label widgets in the tree. This test should use the shared helper instead of manual iteration.
- Line 262-269: Test method `test_various_urls_in_links` manually iterates through children to find Labels with ref markup, duplicating traversal logic. The guidelines provide `find_labels_recursive()` helper from test_utils.py for finding all Label widgets in the tree. This test should use the shared helper instead of manual iteration.

## test_font_properties.py

- Line 27: Custom strategy `line_height_strategy` defined in test file instead of in `test_utils.py`. The guidelines state: "When adding new helper functions: 1. **Add to `test_utils.py`** - Never duplicate in individual test files" and "Always use helper functions from `test_utils.py` instead of duplicating code."
- Line 111: Test method `test_font_name_property_forwarding_triggers_rebuild` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts. The method manually calls `label.force_rebuild()` and then checks widget IDs, rather than testing that the property change naturally triggers a rebuild. The guidelines state: "Test method names should **accurately reflect what they assert**" and provide rebuild testing helpers like `assert_rebuild_occurred()` and `assert_no_rebuild()` for this purpose.
- Line 125: Manual `force_rebuild()` call in rebuild test instead of using `assert_rebuild_occurred()` or `assert_no_rebuild()` helpers from `test_utils.py`. The guidelines provide these helper functions for rebuild contract testing: "Use these helper functions from `test_utils.py`: `def assert_rebuild_occurred(widget, change_func):` and `def assert_no_rebuild(widget, change_func):`"
- Line 226: Test method `test_line_height_change_triggers_rebuild` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts.

- Lines 578-583, 616-620, 652-657, 698-702, 742-747, 826-831: Manual widget traversal to find heading/paragraph labels instead of using shared helper functions from `test_utils.py`. The guidelines provide `find_labels_recursive(widget)` for finding all Label widgets in the tree.
- Lines 111-135, 226-252: Rebuild tests manually collect and compare widget IDs using `collect_widget_ids()` and direct comparison instead of using `assert_rebuild_occurred()` or `assert_no_rebuild()` helpers from `test_utils.py`. The guidelines provide these helper functions for rebuild contract testing.
- Lines 789-810, 820-853, 863-883, 891-921: Tests in `TestNoRebuildOnFontSizeChange` class manually check widget IDs instead of using `assert_no_rebuild()` helper from `test_utils.py`. The guidelines provide this helper function for verifying no rebuild occurred.

## test_color_properties.py

- Line 24-180: Class `TestColorPropertyForwarding` contains tests for multiple distinct color-related behaviors (color property forwarding to paragraphs, headings, list items, tables; code block color preservation; mixed content color separation; link styling). According to the guideline "One class per property or behavior", these should potentially be split into separate classes like `TestColorPropertyForwarding`, `TestCodeBlockColorPreservation`, `TestMixedContentColorSeparation`, and `TestLinkColorStyling` for better organization and clarity.
- Line 82-100: Test method `test_color_change_updates_value` verifies that color changes update the value on existing widgets, but does not verify that the widget tree is preserved (no rebuild occurs). According to the rebuild contract testing guidelines, style-only properties like `color` should be tested to verify they preserve the widget tree. A complementary test like `test_color_change_preserves_widget_tree` should be added that uses `collect_widget_ids()` to verify no rebuild occurs when color changes.

## test_text_properties.py

- Line 259-277, 435-461, 577-603: Rebuild tests manually collect and compare widget IDs using `collect_widget_ids()` and direct comparison instead of using `assert_rebuild_occurred()` or `assert_no_rebuild()` helpers from `test_utils.py`. The guidelines provide these helper functions for rebuild contract testing: "Use these helper functions from `test_utils.py`: `def assert_rebuild_occurred(widget, change_func):` and `def assert_no_rebuild(widget, change_func):`". The tests `test_text_size_height_change_updates_labels`, `test_unicode_errors_change_triggers_rebuild`, and `test_strip_change_triggers_rebuild` should use these helpers instead of manual ID collection and comparison.

## test_sizing_behavior.py

- Line 515-529: Test method `test_strict_mode_updates_value` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts. The method name suggests it tests value updates, but the actual assertion only checks that `len(label.children) >= 1` after toggling `strict_label_mode`. The method does not verify that the value was updated or that a rebuild occurred. A more accurate name would be `test_strict_mode_toggle_preserves_children_count` or `test_strict_mode_toggle_maintains_widget_tree`.
- Line 515-529: The test method `test_strict_mode_updates_value` does not properly test rebuild contract behavior. According to the rebuild contract testing guidelines, tests that verify rebuild behavior should use helper functions like `assert_rebuild_occurred()` or `assert_no_rebuild()` from `test_utils.py`, or should use `collect_widget_ids()` to compare widget IDs before and after the change. The current test only checks child count without verifying widget identity preservation or rebuild occurrence.
- Line 207-314, 320-555: The test file lacks comprehensive rebuild contract testing for property changes that may trigger rebuilds. According to the guidelines, tests should verify whether property changes trigger rebuilds or preserve the widget tree using `collect_widget_ids()`, `assert_rebuild_occurred()`, or `assert_no_rebuild()` helpers. The current tests only verify property values (size_hint_y, auto_size_height, strict_label_mode) without checking whether the widget tree was rebuilt or preserved.

## test_advanced_compatibility.py

- Line 689-708: Test method `test_halign_updates_value` does not verify rebuild contract behavior. According to the rebuild contract testing guidelines, tests for style-only property changes should verify that the widget tree is preserved (no rebuild occurs) using `collect_widget_ids()` to compare widget IDs before and after the change. The current test only verifies that the value was updated on existing widgets without checking whether the widget tree was preserved.
- Line 716-735: Test method `test_valign_updates_value` does not verify rebuild contract behavior. According to the rebuild contract testing guidelines, tests for style-only property changes should verify that the widget tree is preserved (no rebuild occurs) using `collect_widget_ids()` to compare widget IDs before and after the change. The current test only verifies that the value was updated on existing widgets without checking whether the widget tree was preserved.
- Line 834-852: Test method `test_rebuild_preserves_content_structure` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts. The method only checks that the number of children is preserved (children count), not the full content structure. A more accurate name would be `test_rebuild_preserves_children_count` or `test_rebuild_preserves_widget_count`.
- Line 155-181, 187-213, 359-408, 768-789, 858-879, 885-906: Rebuild tests manually collect and compare widget IDs using `collect_widget_ids()` and direct comparison instead of using `assert_rebuild_occurred()` or `assert_no_rebuild()` helpers from `test_utils.py`. While the guidelines provide examples of manual rebuild testing, they also provide helper functions for rebuild contract testing. Using these helpers would make the tests more consistent and maintainable. The affected tests are: `test_font_kerning_change_triggers_rebuild`, `test_font_blended_change_triggers_rebuild`, `test_disabled_change_triggers_rebuild`, `test_strip_updates_value`, `test_font_kerning_updates_value`, and `test_font_blended_updates_value`.

## test_serialization.py

- Line 27-77: Custom helper methods `_normalize_ast` and `_merge_adjacent_text` defined in test class instead of in `test_utils.py`. The guidelines state: "When adding new helper functions: 1. **Add to `test_utils.py`** - Never duplicate in individual test files" and "Always use helper functions from `test_utils.py` instead of duplicating code."
- Line 613-620: The strategy combining `st.text(min_size=0, max_size=200)` and `st.text(alphabet=st.characters(whitelist_categories=('L', 'N')), min_size=0, max_size=20)` is classified as "Combination strategy: 20 examples (adequate coverage)". This is actually a combination of two complex/infinite strategies, not finite strategies. According to the guidelines, "Combination strategy" classification is for combining finite strategies where the product can be calculated. This should be classified as "Complex strategy" with rationale about combining two complex text generation strategies.

## test_performance.py

- Line 30-33: Strategy combining two `st_font_size(min_value=10, max_value=50)` calls is classified as "Combination strategy: 20 examples (adequate coverage)" but these are complex/infinite strategies (continuous float ranges), not finite strategies. The guidelines state that "Combination strategy" classification is for combining finite strategies where the product can be calculated. This should be classified as "Complex strategy" with rationale about testing font size changes with different initial and new values.
- Line 55-57: Strategy `st_rgba_color()` is classified as "Combination strategy: 20 examples (adequate coverage)" but this is actually a complex/infinite strategy (continuous RGBA color space), not a finite strategy.

## test_shortening_and_coordinate.py

- Line 331: Test method `test_shorten_change_updates_value` name does not accurately reflect what it asserts. The method name suggests it only tests value updates, but the actual implementation tests that changing the `shorten` property triggers a rebuild (via `force_rebuild()`) and verifies the new value is applied. According to the rebuild contract testing guidelines, tests that verify rebuild behavior should use names like `test_*_triggers_rebuild_*` or `test_*_rebuilds_*`. A more accurate name would be `test_shorten_change_triggers_rebuild_with_new_value` or `test_shorten_change_rebuilds_with_new_value`.

The guidelines state: "When adding new helper functions: 1. **Add to `test_utils.py`** - Never duplicate in individual test files" and "Always use helper functions from `test_utils.py` instead of duplicating code." The strategies `st.text(min_size=1, max_size=50, alphabet=st.characters(whitelist_categories=['L', 'N']) | st.just('_'))` and the combination of `st.sampled_from([...])` with `st.text(...)` should be extracted as reusable strategy functions in test_utils.py.
- Line 156-157: Strategy combining `st.sampled_from([...])` (5 assertion types, finite) and `st.text(...)` (complex/infinite text generation) is classified as "Combination strategy: 30 examples (combination coverage)". This is incorrect. The guidelines state: "Combination strategy classification is for combining finite strategies where the product can be calculated." Since one strategy is complex/infinite (text generation), this should be classified as "Complex strategy" with rationale about testing assertion classification consistency across different test structures and assertion types.
- Line 156-157: The comment "# Combination strategy: 30 examples (combination coverage)" should be "# Complex strategy: 30 examples (testing assertion classification consistency across different test structures and assertion types)" to accurately reflect the strategy type.
